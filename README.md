# MERNtoMENS
Create a MERN stack then convert to MENS (Mongo Express Node Svelte)
All packages can be pulled, need to run npm i to install node modules required for each package.
34 Stack is the Svelte front-end source.
api is the Node Express backend Rest API.
fetchData is the React version of the front-end.
Mongo layer can be setup following the directions for running the Docker version
I will update with link to YouTube video showing how to do this once it is uploaded by Friday Dec 16th!
